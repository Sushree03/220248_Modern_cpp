Arrangements or structuring of data
A) consecutively, one after the other in memory 
    a) No option for adding no data will be provided  [Array arrangement, no extra data can be added]

    [ 28   |       35       |       29   ]   ///////////
     0x100H        0x104H           0X108H

    b) We can add more data values if required, in future  [VECTOR ARRANGEMENT, extra data can be added]

     [ 28     |       35       |       29   ]   
     0x100H          0x104H           0X108H

Employee 4: 36

    [ 28     |       35       |       29       |      ///     ]    
     0x100H          0x104H           0X108H          ///

            We don't have extra memory and compiler can't give extra memory
            to store, so we have to transfer/shift all the data to another location
            //TRANSFER DATA TO A NEW REGION

            If we have to constantly add data then vector is not the correct choice

    [ 28     |       35       |       29       |      36    ]    
     0x200H          0x204H           0X208H          0X212H


EVERYTHING IS AN ILLUSION

THERE IS NO ARRAY, THERE IS NO STACK, THERE IS NO LIST
