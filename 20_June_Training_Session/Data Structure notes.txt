Arrangements or structuring of data
A) consecutively, one after the other in memory 
    a) No option for adding no data will be provided  [Array arrangement, no extra data can be added]

    [ 28   |       35       |       29   ]   ///////////
     0x100H        0x104H           0X108H

    b) We can add more data values if required, in future  [VECTOR ARRANGEMENT, extra data can be added]

     [ 28     |       35       |       29   ]   
     0x100H          0x104H           0X108H

Employee 4: 36

    [ 28     |       35       |       29       |      ///     ]    
     0x100H          0x104H           0X108H          ///

            We don't have extra memory and compiler can't give extra memory
            to store, so we have to transfer/shift all the data to another location
            //TRANSFER DATA TO A NEW REGION

            If we have to constantly add data then vector is not the correct choice

    [ 28     |       35       |       29       |      36    ]    
     0x200H          0x204H           0X208H          0X212H


EVERYTHING IS AN ILLUSION

THERE IS NO ARRAY, THERE IS NO STACK, THERE IS NO LIST
    



THINGS NOBODY TELLS ABOUT Data Structure

a) Data Structures are Arrangements of data, different ways of 
retrieving or accessing data.

b) Data Structures are theoretical and philosophical. They have to be
implemented through code.

c) Implementations of Data Structucture on different platforms or 
in different library may differ in behavior.

d) There are "infinite" data structures in the world.

e) Data Structures implementations have to follow rules/syntax of the language.
