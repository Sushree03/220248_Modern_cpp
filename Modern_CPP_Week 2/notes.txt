make a software that "DOES SOMETHING" after account is registered with the bank






DoSomething(    action   ) {
    action(emailID, number);
}

DoSomething(  sendWelcomeEmail   )   //callback functions

DoSomething(  sendWhatsappMsgAndEmail   )


Rules:
1)Functions are objects
2)Certain patterns are there (mapping, filtered )





Sample_solution scenarios:

1) findVowels
        scenario 1: string value has at least 1 vowel----> print it

        scenario 2: string has no vowel character ---> exception case ----> std::character

        scenario 3: the input character is blank ---> exception case ---> break from the loop (throw an error)

        scenario 4: a certain string is blank "" ---> exception case ---> std::cerr
