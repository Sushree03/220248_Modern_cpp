Modern CPP
    -All versions of C++ since C++11

CPP is revised/updated every 3 years

So versions of c++ arr : C++11, C++14, C++17...

  C -> Concurrency & C++ 17
  D -> STL Ds & Algorithms

class - user defined data type
copy constructor - duplicates the data 

Feature 1: In class initialization
Feature 2: Enum class
Fearure 3: Enable / disable member functions
           aka defaulted / deleted member functions

        You can choose whether to enable or disable 6 special
        member functions for a class you are creating

        a) Default constructor
        b) destructor
        c) copy constructor
        d) copy assignment operator = (overload = operator)
        e) move constructor (new feature in C++ 11)
        f) move assignemnr operator = (overload = operator for move)

Feature 4: NU;; is replaced with nullptr   //to avoid confusion of null = 0

Feature 5: uniform initialization

We can initialize variables in a function using {}

NULL alter name for 0
e.g - Employee* ptr = 0; // valid case

//dom actions only on pointer type "null"?

Feature 6: member list initialization

Feature 7: auto keyword
            detect and infer the type of variable
            BASED ON INITIAL VALUE

Feature 8: Constructor delegation
        You can transfer/shift control of the program from one constructor to another IN THE SAME CLASS

Feature 9: Additional numeric type with specific size in memory

Feature 10: For each (range-based for loop)

Feature 11: Emplace data in containers (in-place construction of values within the container)
