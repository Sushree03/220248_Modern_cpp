Rule 1: 2 ways to write a path
    a) Absolute path - a path that starts from the / the startimg point and goes to end of the path
    b) Relative path- give location with respect to (assume your current location is already known by the compiler)


. is current file 
.. one above 
~(telda)  the home path 
cd  -   : will go back to previous location
Tab Tab : used to check the files present inside that particular folder
in vim
dd: delete
yy: copy
p: paste
has context menu



ls commands


1) ls with no arguments - current location is called or pwd for present working directory
2) can run ls by providing a location    e.g - ls   /home/kpit/Desktop  (location of desktop)
3) if one location is not sufficient then we can provide multiple locations at the same time     e.g-  ls     ~/Desktop      ~/Documents/
        e.g- ls   ~/Desktop/   ~/Documents/   /tmp/
4) ls   --help  //


# cp means ctrl c ctrl v
# mv means ctrl x ctrl v


# command-name <options> source destination

cp  1.txt   demo.txt
